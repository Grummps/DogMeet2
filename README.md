# DogMeet
This MERN stack implementation creates a web application that enables dog owners to connect and organize meetups at dog parks. Users can add each other as friends, chat in real-time with their friends, add and upload pictures of their dogs, upload profile pictures, select their closest dog parks, and manage social events at these parks.

Not currently deployed on the hosting site for money concerns.
